    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Moussaka is an eggplant- and/or potato-based dish, often including ground meat, in the Levant, Middle East, and Balkans, with many local and regional variations. In Greece and Cyprus, for example, it is made without potatoes, with the eggplants arranged in a cross-layer, and ground beef is often used.</p>
    <h2>Moussaka Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplants, sliced lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick slices</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Brush eggplant slices with olive oil on both sides, and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until tender. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, and cook until evenly browned. Remove from the heat, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until tender. Stir in garlic, and cook for a few minutes until fragrant. Stir in the wine, scraping any bits of beef from the bottom of the pan, then stir in tomato sauce. Season with cinnamon, oregano, allspice, and parsley. Simmer for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat. Stir in the meat, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour until smooth. Cook, stirring until light brown. Gradually whisk in milk so that no lumps form. Bring to a boil, and cook until thickened. Remove from the heat, and stir in nutmeg and 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Place half of the eggplant slices in the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread meat mixture evenly over the eggplant. Cover with remaining eggplant slices, then pour cheese sauce over the top. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until sauce is bubbly.</li>
